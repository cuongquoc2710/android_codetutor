Main_UIThread

1. Your code run on UI/Main Thread by default.
2. Action takes more than 5 seconds (connect service, download image... ) on UI Thread -> not responding
3. Create a seperate thread and execute action in this thread.
4. But cannot update the UI view on seperate thread -> using Handler and Looper.
5. If update view on seperate thread -> Error: Only the original thread that created a view hierarchy can touch its views.
6. Android maintans a queue which is called as a message queue. It was populated with tasks (update the UI, click the button...)
7. UI thread is under constant loop (Looper) will execute tasks.
8. Seperate thread cannot directly put the task in that particular queue.
9. Thread using Handler to put the task in to queue. The task should be of type Runnable instance. 
Handle should have a reference to the message queue of the UI thread.
