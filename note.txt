Main_UIThread

1. Your code run on UI/Main Thread by default.
2. Action takes more than 5 seconds (connect service, download image... ) on UI Thread -> not responding
3. Create a seperate thread and execute action in this thread.
4. But cannot update the UI view on seperate thread -> using Handler and Looper
